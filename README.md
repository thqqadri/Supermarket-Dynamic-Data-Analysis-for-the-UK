# Supermarket-Dynamic-Data-Analysis-for-the-UK
Retailers and their different formats are opening up thick and fast, providing customers with
choice. With so many new stores do we all know where the competition is? Supermarket
information is available and online for everyone to access but not in one file.
Geolytix work on many projects that start with the foundations being supermarket locations,
anyone working with data of any kind knows that the results of any processes can only be as
good as the quality of data going in in the first instance.
Retail Points is a database of supermarkets which have been rooftop located and attributed
with store name, address including postcode, the Geolytix seamless towns and localities, an
open date where known and a four way classification for size band of store. There is no
commercial sensitive data included and the data is fully open therefore you can use it in any
way you like.
